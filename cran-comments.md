## Release summary

Fairly major update. We tried to limit the disruption as much as possible, 
but this introduces a few breaking changes that are documented in the NEWS file. 

Maintainers have been notified twice: a month ago and a week ago. 
We confirmed that all changes were deliberate (either bug fixes or deliberate API changes) and provided guidance on how to update existing code
